# CAN Protocol Projects 
This repository contains a series of hands-on mini projects simulating various aspects of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol using the C programming language.

## Project List
1. **MiniProject-1: CAN Encoder-Decoder**
   - Bit-packing and unpacking logic for CAN frames.

2. **MiniProject-2: CAN Bus Simulation**
   - Random message generation, writing to file, and node filtering.

3. **MiniProject-3: CAN Error Handling**
   - CRC generation, error injection, and type identification.

4. **MiniProject-4: CAN FD Simulator**
   - Flexible Data Format message encoding with BRS flag support.

5. **MiniProject-5: CAN Network Emulator**
   - [Planned / Coming Soon] â€“ Simulating network of nodes with message routing.

## Highlights
- Written in **pure C**
- Focus on **bitwise operations**, **data structures**, and **real-time systems**
- Structured like **automotive test simulations**

## Usage
Each folder contains:
- Source code (`.c`, `.h`)
- A standalone `README.md` with explanation
- Sample test case or log

## Milestones
Refer to [`Milestones.md`](./Milestones.md) for project-by-project progress tracking.
